## Finding enzymes within Prokka files
This is the same code that can be found on https://github.com/sipesk/BioinfomaticsCode/blob/master/finderscript.ipynb. When given .tsv files made from PROKKA v 1.14.6 and a csv file of the gene names wanted to search for then it will output a pivot table of the number of times the gene was counted.

## Bowtie Reads Per Kilobase per million mapped reads between Metagenomes and Cultures
The is the same coude that can be found on https://github.com/sipesk/NEW-bowtie. When given the bowtie outputs and the total reads in the metagenome the code computes the RPKM for each read mapping.
